# About

This program examines most efficient algorithms (Ford–Fulkerson, Hungarian and Hungarian+ algorithms) for finding the maximum matching in bipartite graphs and compares them.

# Theory

A matching in a Bipartite Graph is a set of the edges chosen in such a way that no two edges share an endpoint. A maximum matching is a matching of maximum size (maximum number of edges). In a maximum matching, if any edge is added to it, it is no longer a matching. There can be more than one maximum matchings for a given Bipartite Graph.
